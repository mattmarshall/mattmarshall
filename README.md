# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a full-stack software engineer in the Greater Boston area. Since 2016 I've been leading technology development at my
startup [@loticlabs](https://github.com/loticlabs) (ðŸ‘ˆ check it out or go to [loticlabs.com](https://loticlabs.com)).

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented engineer with a strong background in mathematics and physics. I had the good fortune
to study computer science at MIT and interact with some brilliant minds. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn
and to challenge myself.

I am trying to put together a better showcase of my work, but most of it is in private repos. If you're interested in
seeing more, please reach out!
